description: Run Your Simulation!
---

To run a TRUST simulation, all you have to do is write a correctly formatted data file. This is one of the advantages offered by the platform, allowing the user to change, modify, and test calculations without needing to write C++ code or recompile/link with the TRUST library. However, there is a specific syntax that must be respected to ensure that the TRUST interpreter can read the data file correctly and perform the necessary calculations.

**Attention**: TRUST is sensitive to empty spaces. To avoid issues, use an empty space before and after each keyword. For example, **Read_MED{domain dom file Mesh.med}** won't work! You should write **Read_MED { domain dom file Mesh.med }** (note the spaces before and after the  braces `{ ... }`).

**Attention**: It is possible to write comments in you data file. This can be done by the **#** character; **#** at the begining and at the end of the commented line/paragraph. It is also possible to put your comments between **/*** and ***/**, as the bloc comments in C++. Again, attention to the empty spaces. See these examples:

	# THIS IS A COMMENT #
	/* THIS ALSO */
	
	/* THESE
		ARE
		ALSO
		COMMENTS */
		
	# THESE
		TOO
		...
		YES ! #
		
	#THIS IS NOT GOOD! NEED SPACES#
	/*THIS IS BAD TOO*/
	
	// THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE NOOO
	
	# THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS NOT CLOSED
	
	/* NEITHER IS THIS

In this section, we will consider an example of a test case where all the steps required to write the corresponding data file will be detailed. The selected example is a 2D flow around a square obstacle in an open domain (Von Karman vortex street). We recommend to use the SI units for all quantities (velocity, viscosity, etc.).

# Step 1: Create an empty data file

Create an empty data file named Obstacle.data in an empty Obstacle repository.

# Step 2: Create your mesh

Prepare a meshed domain that will be used in the simulation. In this example, a mesh named `Mesh` defined on a domain named `dom` and written in a MED file named `Mesh.med` is used. The MED file includes five boundaries:

- Square: representing the obstacle
- Upper: representing the upper-top boundary
- Lower: representing the lower-bottom boundary
- Inlet: representing the inlet-left boundary
- Outlet: representing the outlet-right boundary

It is important to note the names of all the boundaries because they will need to be specified when imposing boundary conditions. Here is a visualization of the mesh used in the simulation.

<img src="https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/cea-trust-platform.github.io/blob/master/images/simulation/mesh.png?raw=true" alt="Mesh" width="700"/>

Now, you can start constructing your data file.

**Note:** You can get the Mesh.med file used in this section by doing

	wget https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/cea-trust-platform.github.io/blob/master/images/simulation/Mesh.med

# Step 3: Define the domain and read the mesh

You should start by defining the dimension of the domain. In this case it is 2D.

You should then create an instance of the `Domaine` class, named dom as that you used in the MED file.

Read the MED file and the mesh using the class `Read_MED`. Since the generated mesh was a bit coarse, TRUST allows you to refine the mesh if you like to. This can be done via the class `Raffiner_isotrope ` applied to your domain `dom`.

Start by inserting this in Obstacle.data

	# Dimension can be 2D or 3D #
	dimension 2
	
	# Domain definition #
	Domaine dom
	
	# Read the mesh from MED file #
	Read_MED { domain dom file Mesh.med }

	# Refine the mesh to have better results (optional) #
	Raffiner_isotrope dom

# Step 4: Define the discretization and the problem

The mesh used here allow us to use the VDF discretization. So use the class `VDF` to create an instance with the variable `my_discretisation`.

We will solve just the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, so it is a hydraulic problem. Create an instance of `Pb_hydraulique` and name it `pb`.

Insert this in Obstacle.data 

	# Discretization on rectangles (hexa), so use VDF #
	VDF my_discretisation
	
	# Problem definition #
	Pb_hydraulique pb

# Step 5: Define the time integration scheme

Its for you to define what time scheme to use. Here, we will use the Euler explicit scheme. For that, we create an instance of `Scheme_euler_explicit`, I called it `my_scheme`, and we read its parameters. 

This bloc contains a lot of parameters, try to read the comments and insert the bloc in Obstacle.data.

	# Define your time scheme; here use explicit #
	Scheme_euler_explicit my_scheme
	Read my_scheme
	{
	    # Initial time [s] #
	    tinit 0
	
	    # Min time step #
	    dt_min 5.e-6
	
	    # Max time step #
	    dt_max 5.e-3
	
	    # facsec such as dt = facsec * min(dt(CFL),dt_max) ; for explicit scheme facsec <= 1. By default facsec equals to 1 #
	    facsec 0.5
	
	    # Output criteria #
	    # .out files printing period #
	    dt_impr 5.e-3 # Note: small value to print at each time step #
	
	    # End time [s] of the simulation #
	    tmax 10.0
	}

# Step 6: Assosciate the instantiated objects

Now, you need to link the domaine, the discretization and the time scheme to the problem. This is done by the C++ class `Associate` and `Discretize`.

Insert this in Obstacle.data

	# Association between the different objects #
	Associate pb dom /* Assosciate domaine */
	Associate pb my_scheme /* Assosciate time scheme */
	Discretize pb my_discretisation /* Discretize the domain */
	
# Step 7: Read the problem (medium, equation, BC's, post-processings)

That's the main point now: define the problem!

Start by defining the incompressible medium `Fluide_incompressible`.

Once done, read the Navier-Stokes equation `Navier_Stokes_standard`. Provide the pressure solver `Solveur_pression` and the spatial scheme to be used for the convection operator (here we use the third order `Quick` scheme). 

Precise the initial and boundary conditions. This is done by the `Initial_conditions` and `Boundary_conditions` keywords. Here, we consider that the fluid is at rest at the initial state; so the velocity field is null. At the boundaries, we consider a no-slip BC at the obstacle borders and symmetry at the top/bottom walls. At the inlet, we fix the horizontal velocity to 1 m/s, while the pressure is fixed at the outlet (open boundary).

Finally, ask TRUST to write you the velocity and vorticity fields to visualize them after! Thus, create and read a `Post_processing` object.

Try to read carefully the syntax/comments and insert the bloc in Obstacle.data.

	# Problem description #
	Read pb
	{
	    # Physical characteristcs of medium #
	    Fluide_incompressible 
	    {
	        # Dynamic viscosity [kg/m/s] #
	        mu Champ_Uniforme 1 3.7e-05
	        # Volumic mass [kg/m3] #
	        rho Champ_Uniforme 1 2
	    }
	
	    # NS equation #
	    Navier_Stokes_standard
	    {
	        # Pressure matrix solved with #
	        Solveur_pression PETSc Cholesky { }
	
	        # Solve the convection operator with a 3rd order QUICK scheme #
	        Convection { quick }

	        # Solve the diffusion too; remember diffusion always 2nd order centered #
	        Diffusion { }
	
	        # Uniform initial condition for velocity #
	        Initial_conditions { vitesse Champ_Uniforme 2 0. 0. }
	
	        # Boundary conditions #
	        Boundary_conditions 
	        {
	            Square 	paroi_fixe
	            Upper  	symetrie
	            Lower 	symetrie
	            Outlet 	frontiere_ouverte_pression_imposee Champ_front_Uniforme 1 0.
	            Inlet 	frontiere_ouverte_vitesse_imposee Champ_front_Uniforme 2 1. 0.
	        }
	    }
	
	    # Post_processing description #
	    Post_processing
	    {
	        # Fields #
	        format lata
	        fields dt_post 1.e-2
	        {
	            vitesse som
	            vorticite som
	        }
	    }
	}
	
# Step 8: Solve the problem!

Now, end your data file by inserting this bloc. This will tell TRUST to run and solve the problem.

	# The problem is solved with #
	Solve pb

Save your Obstacle.data file and run the simulation by doing:

	trust Obstacle.data

# Results! It's cool 🍻🤗🍻

Now, you can visualize your results! You should see an animation similar to the one shown below! It is the well known Von Karman vortex street!
