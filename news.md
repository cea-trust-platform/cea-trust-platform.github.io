## **TRUST**'s user and developper training

- The **TRUST** team organise a user training in October's 9 and 10. The training is already full, stay tunned for the announcement of the next training dates.

## Seminars

- On October 1st and 2nd the TrioCFD users’ day will take place at Palais des Congrès, Massy, near Paris. TrioCFD is one of the main application based on the **TRUST** platform, and focuses on small scale and CFD simulations.

## Trainings and Hackathon 

- Training: Introduction to CUDA C++ *01/10 & 02/10 2025*. We are happy to host Nicolas Blin (Devtech @Nvidia) for his introductory course to GPU programming with CUDA C++. Topics included are: 
   - Introduction: CUDA & GPU Architecture
   - More hardware + modern GPU programming
   - Reduces & Nsight Compute
   - Hand on session

- Hackathon: The **TRUST** team took part in the [NVidia GPU OpenHackathon](https://www.idris.fr/annonces/idris-gpu-hackathon-2025.html) initiative co-organised by IDRIS in May '25. The team was mentored directly by a DevTech from NVidia. This allowed to increase the expertise of the team in the profiling tools provided by NVidia, and to optimize the TRUST compute kernels already ported on GPUs. A similar initiative will follow on AMD architectures.

## Last publication

- A paper regarding the GPU porting of **TRUST** has been accepted in [EPJ Nuclear Sciences & Technologies](https://www.epj-n.org/articles/epjn/abs/2025/01/epjn20250034/epjn20250034.html).
